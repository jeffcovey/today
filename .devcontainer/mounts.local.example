# Local mount configuration for devcontainer
# Copy this file to mounts.local and customize for your system
#
# IMPORTANT: For bind mounts to work, you must ALSO add corresponding
# entries to devcontainer.json's "mounts" array. This file documents
# your desired mounts and creates symlinks after container start.
#
# Step 1: Add to devcontainer.json (before rebuilding container):
#
#   "mounts": [
#     {
#       "source": "/path/on/host",
#       "target": "/workspaces/today/foldername",
#       "type": "bind"
#     }
#   ]
#
# Step 2: Add to this file (for documentation/symlink fallback):
#
#   foldername=/path/on/host
#
# Format: target=source
#   target: folder name in /workspaces/today/
#   source: absolute path on your host machine
#
# Examples:

# Obsidian vault synced via iCloud (macOS)
# vault=/Users/username/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/vault

# Additional project repositories
# my-rails-app=/Users/username/src/rails/my-rails-app
