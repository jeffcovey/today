longDescription = """
Runs markdownlint-cli2 with --fix to automatically correct markdown formatting
issues in your vault files.

This plugin requires markdownlint-cli2 to be installed (included in devDependencies).

## Performance Optimization

For best performance, enable the **vault-changes** plugin alongside this one.
When vault-changes is enabled, markdownlint-cleanup will only process files
that have actually changed today, instead of scanning all files. This can
reduce sync time from minutes to seconds on large vaults.

## Common Fixes

- Consistent heading styles
- Proper list indentation
- Blank lines around headings and code blocks
- Trailing whitespace removal (configurable)

Configure rules in .markdownlint.jsonc at the project root.
