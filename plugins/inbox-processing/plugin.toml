Processes files dropped into the inbox directory and routes them based on content:

- **Progress notes** (title "Progress") → Added to diary file
- **Concern notes** (title "Concerns") → Added to diary file
- **Task-only files** (only checkboxes) → Appended to tasks.md
- **Unrecognized files** → Left in inbox for user review

Processed files are moved to .trash within the inbox directory and automatically
