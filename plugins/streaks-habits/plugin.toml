Provides access to daily habit data from the Streaks iOS app (https://streaksapp.com).

Streaks is a habit tracking app that helps you build good habits by tracking daily tasks.
It syncs uncompleted tasks to a markdown file in your vault.

Setup:
1. Install Streaks on your iOS device from the App Store
2. Configure Streaks to export to your vault via Shortcuts or manual export
3. The export file should be saved to `vault/logs/Streaks.md`

The file contains one habit per line, with optional duration:
- Simple habit: `Do Tai Chi Standing`
- Habit with duration: `Read Offline, 2m 30s`
- Apple Health linked (♥︎ prefix): `♥︎ Walk 6,500 Steps`

Items in this file are uncompleted habits for the day.

aiInstructions = """
Daily habit data from Streaks is in `vault/logs/Streaks.md`.

Format: One habit per line
- Simple: `Habit name`
- With duration: `Habit name, Xm Ys`
- Apple Health linked: `♥︎ Habit name` (these sync with Apple Health)

The file shows UNCOMPLETED habits for today. An empty file means all habits are done.

When reviewing daily progress:
1. Read `vault/logs/Streaks.md` to see remaining habits
2. Habits with ♥︎ prefix are linked to Apple Health metrics
3. Suggest scheduling time blocks for uncompleted habits
