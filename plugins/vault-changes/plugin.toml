Scans the vault directory for markdown files and tracks changes using content-aware detection.

Compares current file checksums against stored values in the database to distinguish:
- **added**: New files not previously tracked
- **modified**: Files where content actually changed
- **deleted**: Files that were tracked but no longer exist
- **touched**: Files where mtime changed but content is identical

Use write command with `action: "update-baseline"` to save current state to database.
This should be run after completing work to establish the new baseline.
