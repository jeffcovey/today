longDescription = """
Reports which vault files have changed today and provides git status information.

This plugin displays context about:
- Files added, modified, or deleted today
- Git branch, uncommitted changes, and unpushed commits
- Today's commit history

The underlying change tracking is handled by the core vault-changes module
(src/vault-changes.js) which is always available to other plugins regardless
of whether this display plugin is enabled.

Disabling this plugin only hides the context display - it does not affect
change tracking used by other plugins like markdownlint-cleanup.
