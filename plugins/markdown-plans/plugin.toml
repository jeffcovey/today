longDescription = """
Provides the current plan hierarchy (year → quarter → month → week → day)
as context for AI assistants to align daily work with long-term goals.

When run, this plugin:
1. Creates today's and tomorrow's daily plan files from templates
2. Generates daily summaries for past days using AI
3. Suggests focus and priorities for tomorrow based on open tasks/events
4. Generates AI themes and goals for current/future plans missing them
5. Generates AI summaries for past weekly/monthly/quarterly plans missing them
6. Updates future plan files with scheduled projects

AI-generated content pulls from all database tables (diary, time_logs, habits,
events, tasks, projects, health_metrics, etc.) to create specific, contextual
themes and summaries unique to each time period.

File naming pattern:
- Year:    YYYY_00.md           (e.g., 2025_00.md)
- Quarter: YYYY_Q#_00.md        (e.g., 2025_Q4_00.md)
- Month:   YYYY_Q#_MM_00.md     (e.g., 2025_Q4_12_00.md)
- Week:    YYYY_Q#_MM_W##_00.md (e.g., 2025_Q4_12_W51_00.md)
- Day:     YYYY_Q#_MM_W##_DD.md (e.g., 2025_Q4_12_W51_17.md)
