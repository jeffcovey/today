longDescription = """
Syncs time entries from markdown files in your vault to the database.

Time entries are stored in monthly files (e.g., `2025-12.md`) with one entry per line:

```
2025-12-09T09:00:00-05:00|2025-12-09T10:30:00-05:00|Working on project #topic/programming
2025-12-09T14:00:00-05:00|2025-12-09T15:00:00-05:00|Meeting with team #topic/meetings
```

The current timer (if running) is stored in `current-timer.md`.

This plugin reads the markdown files and syncs them to SQLite for querying.
"""

aiInstructions = """
To check current ongoing activity, read `{directory}/current-timer.md`.
To see entries, read `{directory}/YYYY-MM.md` for the relevant month.

Each line in the monthly file is: `START_ISO8601|END_ISO8601|Description #topic/tag`
Example: `2025-12-09T09:00:00-05:00|2025-12-09T10:30:00-05:00|Working on code #topic/programming`
