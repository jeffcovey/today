# Concerns

Thing I'm worried about on August 8, 2025:

- I'm not keeping track of my income and expenses, especially long-term expenses like homeowners insurance, and I'm afraid I'll have to keep withdrawing from my Roth 401k.
- I'm overdue replying to Melv and David Edwards and Rosemary
- Apple Health says my resting heart rate is high and I'm not getting enough cardio exercise
- I haven't updated OGM members about recent work
- I don't know whether today's OGM newsletter went out
- I need to decide whether I'm going to Palm Springs with Lou, and whether I can trust him not to get suddenly and baselessly angry with me
- I've been drinking alcohol daily to get myself through the treatment of pain in my hip, and should cut back
- I haven't been responsive to OGM members' bug reports and requests for help
- I'm still overweight. My weight continues to fall steadily, but I need to continue, especially with regard to eating *mindfully*.
- Paperwork is piled up and undone

Most of all, I'm unhappy with my ways of planning and getting things done. I feel overwhelmed, and I don't think I'm doing what's truly most important/urgent first. My main tool is Notion, and my use of it is largely based on August Bradley's PPV system (search "notion ppv august bradley" for details). I mostly like Notion, but it does have some downsides:

1. After years of promises, it still has no offline mode, and waiting for data to load is frustrating.
2. Some functionality breaks or is unavailable on iPad.
3. I don't keep up with my review cycles (this is my fault, but an AI which could review materials within certain dates and summarize would be helpful).
4. It *still*, after all these years, doesn't have repeating tasks.

In addition, I have data in many places that isn't considered because it falls outside of Notion, like:

1. Apple reminders
2. Email
3. Drafts (https://getdrafts.com)
4. Apple Health
5. Streaks (https://streaksapp.com)
6. Apple Notes
7. Bear (https://bear.app)
8. Apple and Google calendars

And others. Much of this could be consolidated into simple text-based files, though I fear losing the visual appeal and clarity of Notion. Some needs specific tools to get data out of silos (like the Apple ecosystem).

I've already begun making tools that interact with Notion and email. I sense that this is a good time to start taking advantage of AI capabilities. I'd like to be able to open a session with an AI which can review all my current data, tasks, projects, appointments, etc., and give me a clear idea of what I should do next.

Let's make a project for making such a system. As a first step, could we set up a two-way synchronization between tasks with "Do dates" on Notion and another tasks app with faster, offline usage? I've used Todoist in the past and found it good to use and very scriptable, but I'm open to any newer or better alternatives.
