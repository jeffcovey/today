> Did we make a mistake in naming our files in vault/plans/? Their filenames were supposed 
  to sort so a year would appear before a quarter, which appeared before a month, which 
  appeared before a week, followed by all the days in that week, followed by the next week,
   etc. So there's a clear grouping and hierarchy.

● I'll check the current naming structure of files in vault/plans/ to see if they follow
  the intended hierarchical sorting.

● List(vault/plans)
  ⎿  Listed 28 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Yes, there's a naming issue. The current structure has problems:

  1. Quarters are named like 2025-Q3.md
  2. Months are named like 2025-Q3-08.md (August in Q3)
  3. Weeks are named like 2025-Q3-08-W33.md
  4. Days are named like 2025-Q3-08-25.md

  The problem: Days (e.g., 2025-Q3-08-10.md) sort alphabetically before weeks (e.g.,
  2025-Q3-08-W33.md) because numbers come before 'W'.

  For proper hierarchical sorting, you'd want:
  - Year: 2025.md ✓
  - Quarter: 2025-Q3.md ✓
  - Month: 2025-Q3-08.md ✓
  - Week: 2025-Q3-08-W33.md → Should be 2025-Q3-08-33.md or 2025-Q3-08-week-33.md
  - Day: 2025-Q3-08-25.md → Should be 2025-Q3-08-25-day.md or 2025-Q3-08-day-25.md

  Or alternatively use prefixes that naturally sort:
  - 2025-Q3-08-1-week-33.md
  - 2025-Q3-08-2-day-25.md

  The current naming causes days to appear before weeks in the sort order.

> No, it's worse than that:  ls -C1 vault/plans/
  2025-Q1.md
  2025-Q2.md
  2025-Q3-08-10.md
  2025-Q3-08-11.md
  2025-Q3-08-12.md
  2025-Q3-08-13.md
  2025-Q3-08-14.md
  2025-Q3-08-15.md
  2025-Q3-08-16.md
  2025-Q3-08-17.md
  2025-Q3-08-18.md
  2025-Q3-08-19.md
  2025-Q3-08-20.md
  2025-Q3-08-21.md
  2025-Q3-08-22.md
  2025-Q3-08-23.md
  2025-Q3-08-24.md
  2025-Q3-08-25.md
  2025-Q3-08-W33.md
  2025-Q3-08-W34.md
  2025-Q3-08.md
  2025-Q3.md
  2025-Q4.md
  2025.md

● You're absolutely right - it's much worse! The files are sorting in this broken order:

  1. 2025-Q1.md (Q1)
  2. 2025-Q2.md (Q2)
  3. 2025-Q3-08-10.md through 2025-Q3-08-25.md (days)
  4. 2025-Q3-08-W33.md, 2025-Q3-08-W34.md (weeks)
  5. 2025-Q3-08.md (month!)
  6. 2025-Q3.md (quarter!)
  7. 2025-Q4.md (Q4)
  8. 2025.md (year!)

  The year, quarter, and month files are appearing after their child elements because of
  alphabetical sorting. The dash-number combinations sort before just the dash alone.

  To fix this hierarchy, you need a naming scheme where parents sort before children:

  Option 1 - Zero padding:
  - 2025-00.md (year)
  - 2025-Q3-00.md (quarter)
  - 2025-Q3-08-00.md (month)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33.md (week)
  - 2025-Q3-08-D10.md (day)

  Option 2 - Underscore prefix:
  - 2025.md (year)
  - 2025-Q3_.md (quarter)
  - 2025-Q3-08_.md (month)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33.md (week)
  - 2025-Q3-08-D10.md (day)

  Option 3 - Type indicators:
  - 2025-Y.md (year)
  - 2025-Q3-Q.md (quarter)
  - 2025-Q3-08-M.md (month)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33.md (week)
  - 2025-Q3-08-D10.md (day)
