2018-07-17 Nurse Practitioner home visit
Things Al should do
☐ see an optometrist once a year
☐ see a podiatrist every three months (Medicare will pay for it)
☐ have the wax cleaned from his ears, either at his doctor's office or with Debrox from a pharmacy
☐ walk outside in the morning or evening when it's cool
☐ check his sugar at home (she doesn't know why Al's doctor said not to do this)
☐ have his hemoglobin and A1C tested every three months
☐ get the shingles vaccine (Al hasn't wanted to pay for it)
Eyes
The cataracts are still there. An optometrist should dilate Al's eyes and check them and also check for glaucoma.
Toes
Al has a fungal infection on his toes. A podiatrist will give him a prescription cream for this which works much better than over-the-counter ones.
Diabetes
Medicare will pay for a glucose meter and blood testing strips. Al should call his insurance company to ask which to buy.
Follow-up
A nurse practitioner will come to the house again in a year.

Al's doctor will have to recommend physical therapy before a therapist can come to the house.
