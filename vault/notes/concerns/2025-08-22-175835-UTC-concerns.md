I skipped the extra Zazen this morning (but joined the group at 8:30). I keep telling myself I have to get things squared away before I can take "time off" like this. I skipped both social events Tuesday and the one Wednesday night for the same reason, and I'm skipping Tropics tonight. I feel like I'm so close to getting back on top of things that I want to press on. I'm especially uneasy about my financial uncertainty, and wonder if I should be spending money on drinks and dinner when I go out.
