# Diet and Exercise

1. Eat only when you’re hungry.
2. Eat exactly what your body wants.
3. Mindfully enjoy every bite.
4. Stop eating when you’re not hungry any more.

# Depression

> "You know, we should do more of what makes us happy and less of what makes us unhappy."
— John Cleese, to his wife
>

[From 2013:]

Shunryu Suzuki's wife is now quite elderly. Someone recently asked her how to live a long life. She said:

1. Walk every day.
2. Don't hate anyone.
3. Have good conversations.

> Do enjoyable activities. Think helpful thoughts. Face your fears. Be present. Take care of yourself.

> By understanding the factors that contributed to your anxiety, depression, or other issues, we can be on the lookout for warning signs of a relapse. For example, a woman who recovered from depression can be aware of a tendency to withdraw from activities that keep her feeling well.

> In CBT, we first learn to recognize what our minds are telling us, since negative automatic thoughts can happen outside our conscious awareness. Then we test the thoughts for accuracy. With practice, we can develop more helpful ways of thinking.

> if we experience a small failure, like missing our train and being late to a meeting, we might think we’re irresponsible and respond with feelings of guilt and regret. We might enter the meeting tentatively and with words and a demeanor that suggest not just “I’m sorry” but also, “I’ve done something bad.” These thoughts, feelings, and behaviors emanate from the core belief I am inadequate. Being late for the meeting didn’t cause that belief so much as confirm it: “See, here’s yet another example of how I’m defective.”

> We might expect that many safe landings would weaken her fear of flying since they provide evidence against her fear. However, core beliefs act as a filter that only lets in information that confirms our beliefs. Each time Esther flew, she had automatic thoughts like “We’re losing altitude!” that made her think she had narrowly escaped an untimely death. Rather than feeling safer, she was left with the conviction that she might not be so lucky next time.

> Before you enter a challenging situation, review the evidence for the more realistic core belief. You can even rehearse these more accurate ways of thinking when you wake up in the morning and when you lie down to sleep at night—two occasions when our minds can dwell on negative automatic thoughts. This proactive approach is an alternative to always playing defense and can be an effective means of chipping away at core beliefs rather than reinforcing them.

> Many studies have shown the benefits of taking stock of positive events in our lives. The practice is simply to write down at the end of each day three things that went well. Next, write down why they went well: Sheer luck? Something you did? Something another person did? Consistently completing this exercise leads to greater happiness and less depression.

> When we accept that we can’t control what happens, we can step out of that tension. We can recognize that our talk could go really badly, we might lose our health, we could be in an accident, and tragedy could befall the people we love. This kind of acceptance is likely to raise anxiety at first—which is probably why we avoid it—and then can lead to a greater sense of peace as we give up the control we never had in the first place. Embrace uncertainty.

Second, they can actually impair our performance, as when a capable speaker is overly reliant on notes, which prevents him from engaging with the audience. In reality, many of our safety behaviors are useless, but we never realize it if we always use them (just like a superstitious practice we’re afraid to let go of).

### Summary of Buddhist thought from Andrew Davis on the PPV discussion boards

In case it helps to further explain where I'm coming from, after many years of digesting the meaning of Buddha's teachings, the central ideas are closely tied to what's being taught here:

- Our inner and outer worlds are constantly changing
- Our mental models of the world are not changing (we resist change and crave stability)
- Therefore we suffer from failing to accept reality
- The central pillar of our mental model is the "I/self/ego"
- Everything else is "other", and we naturally feel alienated / isolated from other
- Some of the things we see are desirable and we develop cravings and addictions to them small and large
- Some of the things we see are undesirable and we develop fear, irritation, and hatred for them
- What we fear most of all is the idea of going out of existence (death)
- In reality, versions of ourselves are coming into and out of existence moment by moment, primarily as a result of our actions
- every action we engage in implies some view of who we are, as well as who/what others are, what we're doing to them, and what they're doing to us
- Our compulsive tendencies drive most of our actions which keep recreating limiting versions of ourselves
- We can train our mind through discipline, meditative absorption, and wisdom to act differently, see ourselves and others differently, and ensure our minds are in harmony with reality.

  ### **Be very careful how you spend the first and last two hours of each day**

    My closest mentor—one of the most successful leaders in the financial industry—gave me this tidbit early in my career: “Most people wake up reactively, adhering to the world’s needs, not their own.” In a world of unlimited communication, people don’t disconnect from society to analyze their lives.

    The first two hours of your day should be spent aligning your short-term efforts with your long-term goals. I wake up during the week at 3:30 a.m., [taking the time to meditate](https://www.success.com/blog/3-thoughtful-ways-you-can-benefit-from-meditation) and read for 20 minutes. Then I spend an hour doing an intensive workout like circuit training or hiking.

    The last two hours of your day dictates your energy for the next day. I spend an hour studying or [learning a new skill](https://www.success.com/article/22-ways-to-become-a-relentless-learner), and the last hour planning my next day.

    Learn to work harder on yourself than your job.

    <aside>
    🔥 Build an anti-fragile identity. Re-orienting what your ego is based around. What you build your self esteem around matters. Most people build it around being right, good, worthy. These are dead ends. You will inevitably run into things you are not right or good about. If you build around being praised around end results and not the process, you will hit a dead end. Re-orient around being a learner, then you are anti-fragile. -Tom Bilyeu

    </aside>

    Learners seek the faculty to overcome and move forward.

    Have to want something super amazingly badly. Willing to sacrifice ego comfort, and NEED to find truth in pursuit of the goal.

    Have to turn “wants” into crushing NEEDS.  -Tom Bilyeu

  ## Action-Orientation

  - **Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.**
  - **Being successful is rarely about your ability to plan – it’s about your ability to act.**
    - Be careful about over-planning

            <aside>
            👉 Spending too much time designing a system is also a great way to never get started. Over-planning is often procrastination in disguise – our brain loves doing what feels rewarding now (doing research, reading, watching video tutorials) instead of starting the hard work.

            </aside>


  - **Curiosity, courage, and persistence are the new gatekeepers.**
  - **Each day is a new battle to say yes to what matters and say no to what doesn’t. Focus is a practice.**  -James Clear

  ## The "Do" Manifesto

    **Inspired by "[Manifesto of a DOer](https://dolectures.medium.com/manifesto-of-a-doer-dd1baa873f1f)", heavily modified & extended from various inputs and reflections**

    1. The way to attract good luck is to be reliable in a valuable area.The more you repeatedly deliver value, the more people seek you out for that value. Your reputation is a magnet. Once you become known for something, relevant opportunities come to you with no extra work.
    2. "At the higher levels of competitive swimming, something like an inversion of attitude takes place. The very features of the sport that the 'C' swimmer finds unpleasant, the top level swimmer enjoys. What others see as boring—swimming back and forth over a black line for two hours, say—they find peaceful, even meditative, often challenging, or therapeutic. They enjoy hard practices, look forward to difficult competitions, try to set difficult goals. Coming into the 5:30 A.M. practices at Mission Viejo, many of the swimmers were lively, laughing, talking, enjoying themselves, perhaps appreciating the fact that most people would positively hate doing it. It is incorrect to believe that top athletes suffer great sacrifices to achieve their goals. Often, they don’t see what they do as sacrificial at all. They like it.”
    3. What are the minority of my actions that drive the majority of my results?
    4. Deadlines serve you best when they are short, hard and (at first glance) impossible. Urgency gets things done.
        - Set Goals that scare you, that you don't know if you can reach using your existing skills and resources. That high bar pressures you to look for new sources of leverage.
    5. Create a habit of always following through. On the big things. On the small things.
    6. Focus on the goal. If something isn’t pushing the goal forward, it's a distraction. Distractions are the enemy.
    7. Obstacles will come your way, think of them as gifts. They will make you stronger. They will make you more capable. They will define you.
    8. Always ask: "What matters most right now?" That's THE question.
        - "The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing."
    9. Sprint. Rest. Sprint. Rest. We get more done in bursts followed by rest.
    10. Keep your energy for pushing forward. The past is done. Things out of your control cannot be changed. Energy spent being angry, jealous, or cynical is wasted energy. Don't waste energy, use it.
    11. Say no. And say it often. Protect the zone.
    12. Make a pact with failure early on. Don’t fear it.
    13. The energy available to get things done is directly proportional to how much it matters to you. Only commit to things that matter.
    14. Find your multipliers: people, teams, tools that can accelerate the change you want to make.
    15. The few influence the many. Find influencers. Be an influencer.
    16. Every minute that you take away from a core activity, or spend distracted by something else, it takes about twenty-three minutes to get back into that flow state of productivity. Those distracted moments represent an enormous opportunity cost.

  ## Focus

    <aside>
    ⚠️ **Your most persistent distractions will seem justified to you.**

    </aside>

    > How would the person I want to become spend their time? -Nir Eyal
    >

    “The cost of a thing is the amount of ... life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” -Henry David Thoreau

  ## Learning

    <aside>
    💡 "Man,” he said, “you are a *learner*. Tell me. How can I be a learner?”
    “It’s simple. To be a learner, you’ve got to be willing to be a fool.”

    </aside>

  ## Inputs

    "Your actions are a consequence of your thoughts.

    Your thoughts are a consequence of what you consume.

    And in the modern age, what you consume is largely a consequence of how you select and refine your social media feed.

    Choose better inputs. Get better outputs."  *-James Clear*

  ## Effort

    "People with writer’s block don’t have a problem typing. They have a problem living with bad writing. The best way to deal with it is to write, and to realize that bad writing isn’t fatal." -[@SethGodinBlog](https://twitter.com/SethGodinBlog)

    "A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time — most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.

    "Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well. Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way."   *-Sam Altman (Source: [How To Be Successful](https://el2.convertkit-mail4.com/c/75uqdk3kxdc8hwlnnlf9/70c7h8hmp4v58d/aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLnNhbWFsdG1hbi5jb20vaG93LXRvLWJlLXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWw=))*

  ### **Be very careful how you spend the first and last two hours of each day**

    My closest mentor—one of the most successful leaders in the financial industry—gave me this tidbit early in my career: “Most people wake up reactively, adhering to the world’s needs, not their own.” In a world of unlimited communication, people don’t disconnect from society to analyze their lives.

    The first two hours of your day should be spent aligning your short-term efforts with your long-term goals. I wake up during the week at 3:30 a.m., [taking the time to meditate](https://www.success.com/blog/3-thoughtful-ways-you-can-benefit-from-meditation) and read for 20 minutes. Then I spend an hour doing an intensive workout like circuit training or hiking.

    The last two hours of your day dictates your energy for the next day. I spend an hour studying or [learning a new skill](https://www.success.com/article/22-ways-to-become-a-relentless-learner), and the last hour planning my next day.

    Learn to work harder on yourself than your job.

    <aside>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/fire_orange.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/fire_orange.svg" width="40px" /> Build an anti-fragile identity. Re-orienting what your ego is based around.

    What you build your self esteem around matters. Most people build it around being right, good, worthy. These are dead ends. You will inevitably run into things you are not right or good about. If you build around being praised around end results and not the process, you will hit a dead end. Re-orient around being a learner, then you are anti-fragile.

    Have to turn “wants” into crushing NEEDS.

  ## Action-Orientation

  - **Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.**
  - **Being successful is rarely about your ability to plan – it’s about your ability to act.**
    - Be careful about over-planning

            <aside>
            👉 Spending too much time designing a system is also a great way to never get started. Over-planning is often procrastination in disguise – our brain loves doing what feels rewarding now (doing research, reading, watching video tutorials) instead of starting the hard work.

  - **Curiosity, courage, and persistence are the new gatekeepers.**
  - **Each day is a new battle to say yes to what matters and say no to what doesn’t. Focus is a practice.**  -James Clear

  ## The "Do" Manifesto

    **Inspired by "[Manifesto of a DOer](https://dolectures.medium.com/manifesto-of-a-doer-dd1baa873f1f)", heavily modified & extended from various inputs and reflections**

    1. The way to attract good luck is to be reliable in a valuable area.The more you repeatedly deliver value, the more people seek you out for that value. Your reputation is a magnet. Once you become known for something, relevant opportunities come to you with no extra work.
    2. "At the higher levels of competitive swimming, something like an inversion of attitude takes place. The very features of the sport that the 'C' swimmer finds unpleasant, the top level swimmer enjoys. What others see as boring—swimming back and forth over a black line for two hours, say—they find peaceful, even meditative, often challenging, or therapeutic. They enjoy hard practices, look forward to difficult competitions, try to set difficult goals. Coming into the 5:30 A.M. practices at Mission Viejo, many of the swimmers were lively, laughing, talking, enjoying themselves, perhaps appreciating the fact that most people would positively hate doing it. It is incorrect to believe that top athletes suffer great sacrifices to achieve their goals. Often, they don’t see what they do as sacrificial at all. They like it.”
    3. What are the minority of my actions that drive the majority of my results?
    4. Deadlines serve you best when they are short, hard and (at first glance) impossible. Urgency gets things done.
        - Set Goals that scare you, that you don't know if you can reach using your existing skills and resources. That high bar pressures you to look for new sources of leverage.
    5. Create a habit of always following through. On the big things. On the small things.
    6. Focus on the goal. If something isn’t pushing the goal forward, it's a distraction. Distractions are the enemy.
    7. Obstacles will come your way, think of them as gifts. They will make you stronger. They will make you more capable. They will define you.
    8. Always ask: "What matters most right now?" That's THE question.
        - "The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing."
    9. Sprint. Rest. Sprint. Rest. We get more done in bursts followed by rest.
    10. Keep your energy for pushing forward. The past is done. Things out of your control cannot be changed. Energy spent being angry, jealous, or cynical is wasted energy. Don't waste energy, use it.
    11. Say no. And say it often. Protect the zone.
    12. Make a pact with failure early on. Don’t fear it.
    13. The energy available to get things done is directly proportional to how much it matters to you. Only commit to things that matter.
    14. Find your multipliers: people, teams, tools that can accelerate the change you want to make.
    15. The few influence the many. Find influencers. Be an influencer.
    16. Every minute that you take away from a core activity, or spend distracted by something else, it takes about twenty-three minutes to get back into that flow state of productivity. Those distracted moments represent an enormous opportunity cost.

  ## Focus

    <aside>

  ## Learning

    <aside>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/fire_orange.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/fire_orange.svg" width="40px" /> "Man,” he said, “you are a *learner*. Tell me. How can I be a learner?”
    “It’s simple. To be a learner, you’ve got to be willing to be a fool.”

    </aside>

  ## Inputs

    "Your actions are a consequence of your thoughts.

    Your thoughts are a consequence of what you consume.

    And in the modern age, what you consume is largely a consequence of how you select and refine your social media feed.

    Choose better inputs. Get better outputs."  *-James Clear*

  ## Effort

    "People with writer’s block don’t have a problem typing. They have a problem living with bad writing. The best way to deal with it is to write, and to realize that bad writing isn’t fatal." -[@SethGodinBlog](https://twitter.com/SethGodinBlog)

    "A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time — most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.

    "Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well.
