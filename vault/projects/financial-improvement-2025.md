  add-on services. @Heroku | Invoice.html shows the breakdown for 
  last month. Now: How can we combine services, and/or move to 
  cheaper ones?

● I'll analyze your Heroku invoice to understand the breakdown and
  suggest consolidation and cost-saving strategies.

● Based on the Heroku invoice analysis, here's your breakdown and
  recommendations for reducing costs:

  Current Heroku Costs (Monthly):

  - Application dynos: $637.29
    - Performance-L dyno: $400.59/mo ($500/mo rate)
    - Standard dynos: ~$237/mo (various at $25-50/mo)
  - Add-on services: $480.91
    - PostgreSQL (standard-0 + essential-0)
    - Redis (premium-3 + mini)
    - Papertrail logging
    - Scheduler
    - SendGrid Gold
  - Total: $1,183.05 (with tax)

  Cost Reduction Strategy:

  1. Move to Railway.app or Render.com (Save ~$800/mo)

  - Railway: ~$20/mo for similar compute + $10/mo PostgreSQL
  - Render: $25/mo for web service + $20/mo PostgreSQL
  - Both include Redis, cron jobs, and basic logging

  2. Self-host on a VPS (Save ~$1,000/mo)

  - DigitalOcean/Hetzner: $48-96/mo for equivalent compute
  - Use Docker Compose for easy management
  - Free alternatives:
    - PostgreSQL: Self-hosted
    - Redis: Self-hosted
    - Logging: ELK stack or Loki
    - Scheduler: System cron
    - Email: SMTP relay or AWS SES ($0.10/1000 emails)

  3. Consolidate with existing services:

  - You're already paying for AWS ($161/mo) and Linode ($25/mo)
  - Move Heroku apps to these existing servers

  4. Optimize current Heroku usage:

  - ✓ COMPLETED: Downgraded Performance-L to Standard-2X ($50/mo) - saved $450/mo
  - Replace SendGrid Gold with Starter plan - save ~$60/mo
  - Use free Papertrail plan or self-hosted logs - save ~$50/mo

  Recommended Action Plan:

  1. ✓ COMPLETED: Downgraded Heroku dynos (saved $450/mo)
  2. Week 1-2: Set up staging on Railway/Render
  3. Week 3-4: Migrate production with zero downtime
  4. Result: Reduce hosting from $1,183 to ~$150/mo

  Would you like me to create a detailed migration plan for any of
  these options?
