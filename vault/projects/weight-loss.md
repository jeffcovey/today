## Strategy

### Nutrition Approach

- Portion control at social events (Front Stage days)
- Meal prep on Back Stage days
- Track calories if plateau occurs

### Exercise Integration
- **Daily Streaks** (already established):
  - Walk 5,500 steps daily
  - Apple Fitness+ workouts
  - Tai Chi (joint-friendly exercise)
  - Inversion table use
- **Low-Impact Focus**: Prioritize exercises that don't stress joints
  - Swimming/water aerobics
  - Cycling
  - Yoga/stretching

### Behavioral Strategies
- Weekly weigh-ins (not daily to avoid obsession)
- Photo progress monthly
- Celebrate non-scale victories (energy, mobility, pain reduction)
- Use Front Stage accountability (share progress with friends)
