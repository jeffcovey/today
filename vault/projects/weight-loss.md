# Weight Loss Project

## Overview
**Goal:** Achieve sustainable weight loss to reduce joint pressure and improve arthritis symptoms  
**Start Date:** August 20, 2025  
**Current Weight:** 176.90 lbs (as of August 13, 2025)  
**Target Weight:** 165 lbs  
**Target Date:** December 31, 2025  

## Motivation & Connection to Health Goals

### Primary Benefits
- **Reduced Joint Pressure**: Every pound lost reduces knee joint pressure by 4 pounds

- **Improved Mobility**: Easier movement for daily activities and exercise
- **Enhanced Energy**: Better overall energy levels for Front/Back/Off Stage days

### Related Projects

  - Less weight = less joint stress
  - Easier to perform recommended exercises (Tai Chi, stretching)
  - Reduced inflammation markers

## Tracking & Metrics

### Weight Tracking
