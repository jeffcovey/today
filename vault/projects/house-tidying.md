# House Tidying Project

## Core Principle

**Shift from "ready to hand" to "hidden at point of use"**
- Keep items where they will be used, but hidden from view
- Creates open, uncluttered spaces that promote mental clarity
- Provides surfaces for temporary work and bringing things into the house

## Benefits

- Feel lighter and clearer
- Easier to walk around
- More space to put things down when needed
- Less visual clutter

## Room-by-Room Plan

### Kitchen

- [ ] Rice cooker → drawer near cooking area
- [ ] Small appliances → cabinets/drawers where used
- [ ] Clear countertops completely except daily essentials
- [ ] Organize drawer near stove for cooking tools
- [ ] Hide charging cables

### Bathroom

- [ ] Clear counter completely
- [ ] Move toiletries to medicine cabinet or drawer organizers
- [ ] Install drawer dividers for small items
- [ ] Hide hair dryer/straightener in vanity
- [ ] Wall-mount items where possible

### Bedroom

- [ ] Clear dresser top
- [ ] Move daily items to top drawer with organizer
- [ ] Create charging station inside nightstand drawer
- [ ] Hide cables behind furniture

### Living Areas

- [ ] Clear all flat surfaces (coffee table, side tables)
- [ ] Create hidden storage for remotes, chargers
- [ ] Organize items by use location
- [ ] Remove "just in case" items from surfaces

## Cable Management

- [ ] Use cable management boxes for power strips
- [ ] Install under-desk cable trays
- [ ] Use adhesive cable clips along baseboards
- [ ] Get matching cable covers for visible wires
- [ ] Label cables at both ends for easy identification

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with one room at a time
2. Remove everything from surfaces
3. Identify true "point of use" for each item
4. Find hidden storage at that location
5. Only return absolute daily essentials to visible spots
6. Install cable management solutions

## Success Metrics

- All flat surfaces clear except current projects
- Can walk through any room without navigating around items
- Everything has a hidden "home" at its point of use
- No visible cables except when in active use
- Feel of spaciousness and calm in each room
