# Drink Less Project

## Overview
**Goal:** Reduce alcohol consumption for better health, weight management, and improved arthritis symptoms  
**Start Date:** August 20, 2025  
**Current Pattern:** Recent daily cocktails (4-5 doubles per day)  
**Target:** Gradual reduction to healthier levels  
**Tracking:** DrinkControl app exports to `vault/logs/drinks.csv`

## Motivation & Health Connections

### Weight Loss Impact
- **Alcohol calories**: Recent logs show 600-800+ calories/day from drinks
- **Empty calories**: No nutritional value, hindering weight loss goals
- **Metabolism**: Alcohol slows fat burning, body prioritizes alcohol metabolism
- **Late-night eating**: Drinking often leads to poor food choices

### Arthritis & Inflammation
- **Inflammatory response**: Alcohol increases inflammation markers
- **Sleep disruption**: Poor sleep worsens arthritis pain
- **Dehydration**: Alcohol dehydrates joints, increasing stiffness
- **Medication interactions**: May interfere with arthritis medications

### Connected Projects
- **[Weight Loss](./weight-loss.md)**: Cutting drinks = major calorie reduction
- **[Treat Arthritis](./treat-arthritis.md)**: Less inflammation = less joint pain

## Current Drinking Patterns (August 2025)

### Recent Data Analysis
- **Daily average**: 4-5 double cocktails (93-116g alcohol)
- **Calories from alcohol**: 650-850 per day
- **Weekly total**: ~700g alcohol (extremely high)
- **Pattern**: Evening drinking, consistent daily habit

### Health Risks at Current Level
- Well above recommended limits (14 units/week)
- Risk of dependency
- Significant inflammation contribution
- Major weight loss barrier

## Reduction Strategy

### Phase 1: Awareness & Tracking (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Log drinks immediately when consumed
- [ ] Note triggers (stress, boredom, social)
- [ ] Track how you feel next morning
- [ ] Calculate weekly totals

### Phase 2: Gradual Reduction (Weeks 3-6)
- [ ] Reduce by 1 drink per day first week
- [ ] Introduce alcohol-free days (start with 2/week)
- [ ] Replace evening cocktails with mocktails
- [ ] Set "no drinking before X pm" rule

### Phase 3: Sustainable Pattern (Weeks 7+)
- [ ] Target: Maximum 14 units per week
- [ ] Maintain 3-4 alcohol-free days
- [ ] Special occasions only approach
- [ ] Focus on quality over quantity

## Replacement Strategies

### Evening Alternatives
- Fancy mocktails (ritual without alcohol)
- Kombucha or interesting sodas
- Herbal teas for wind-down
- Sparkling water with bitters

### Stress Management (Instead of Drinking)

- Hot bath with Epsom salts

### Social Situations
- Volunteer to be designated driver

## Tracking & Accountability

### Weekly Tasks
