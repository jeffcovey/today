# August 2025 Plan

## Month Theme

Recovery

## Synopsis

At the end of June, I started experiencing chronic pain in my left hip. An appointment with Dr. Carl Eierle at Orthopaedic Center of South Florida on July 21 confirmed arthritis in the joint, but he thinks the problem is muscular. Many of my goals, especially travel, depend on a healthy and active body. I need to start dealing with this chronic condition. In the meantime, less physical activity and more inside time during the hot Florida summer is an opportunity to catch up on my finances and OGM work.
