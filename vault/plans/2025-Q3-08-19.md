**Time:** 9:05 PM EDT  
**Theme:** 🏝️ **Off Stage Day** - Personal time, self-care, reading, nature, social activities

## 🏠 Guest Room Status

### Current Status

- **Both rooms vacant** - No current guests

## 🎯 Primary Focus Areas (Off Stage Priorities)

### 1. 🦴 **Arthritis Treatment & Self-Care** (Week 34 Goal)

**CRITICAL**: You planned to start active treatment for hip arthritis but haven't begun reading "Tight Hip, Twisted Core" book yet. This is your weekly focus and aligns perfectly with Off Stage self-care.

### 2. 🔥 **Address Critical Issue**

- **Honeybadger Error**: SignalException occurred at 8:55 PM today on jeffcovey-sfpix/production
- This needs attention even on Off Stage day (quick check/restart)

### 3. 💰 **Financial Priority**

- **Get cash from IRA** (marked 🔥 Immediate) - Still pending

## ✅ **Completed Today**

- Fixed all hardcoded paths to use vault-based structure
- Resolved duplicate topics directory issue  
- Updated all scripts (bin/progress, bin/status, bin/mark-done, etc.) to use correct vault paths
- Committed and pushed all path corrections
- Database recovery and migration is complete with all data intact

## 🌙 **Evening Priorities** (Before Bed - 9:30 PM)

### Quick Actions (Next 25 minutes)

1. **Check Honeybadger Error** (5 min) - Likely needs dyno restart
2. **Complete Streaks** (15 min):
   - ✅ Read Saved Articles (2m 30s) - Quick win!
   - ✅ Use Inversion Table (5-10 min) - Perfect for hip arthritis
   - ✅ Tai Chi Standing (3m 30s) - Gentle movement
3. **Jay's Patreon Message** (5 min) - Check what he sent

## 💡 **Self-Care Recommendations**

**Tonight (Off Stage Perfect!):**
1. **Start Arthritis Book** (20-30 min) - This is your Week 34 focus
2. **Inversion Table** - Immediate hip relief
3. **Mindful Minutes** - Use for reading or meditation
4. **Early to bed** - You've been working hard

**Why This Matters:**
- Aligns with your "Rebellion" theme - taking charge of your health
- Off Stage day is perfect for personal wellness
- Hip arthritis treatment shouldn't be delayed further

## 📊 **Alignment Check**

Today's activities support:
- **Year Goal**: "Rebellion" - Taking active control of arthritis treatment
- **Q3 Goal**: Health and fitness consistency during summer
- **August Goal**: Core project advancement (but Off Stage = personal focus)
- **Week 34 Goal**: Begin arthritis treatment program

## 🎭 **Stage Theme Reminder**

**Off Stage Tuesday** means:
- ✅ Personal health and wellness (arthritis book!)
- ✅ Self-care activities (Streaks, inversion table)
- ✅ Reading and learning
- ✅ Gentle movement and mindfulness
- ⚠️ Minimal work tasks (just critical issues)
