# Monday, August 25, 2025 - Daily Plan

**Time:** 7:51 AM EDT  
**Theme:** 🎭 **Front Stage Day** (Meetings, communications, customer support)  
**Focus:** Week 5 of August - "Clearing the tables for time with Lou in Palm Springs"

## 🎯 Alignment with Higher Goals

From **Year Plan (2025)**: Guiding word is **"Rebellion"** - Maintaining progress, supporting next generations, self-care
From **Q3 Plan**: Focus on physical/financial health, catching up OGM requests  
From **August Plan**: Recovery month - healthier habits, OGM catch-up, data migration

## ✅ Morning Routine (Complete!)

All Streaks habits are done! Great start to the day.

## 🔥 Critical Issues

### OGM Production Monitoring
