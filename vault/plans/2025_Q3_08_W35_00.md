## Risk Mitigation

### Health Implementation Risk

- **Risk**: Another week of "planning to plan"
- **Mitigation**: Monday's ONLY task is extracting Day 1 routine
- **Accountability**: Post routine in daily review file

### Technical Distraction Risk

- **Risk**: Getting pulled into interesting technical projects
- **Mitigation**: Health tasks MUST complete before any technical work
- **Boundary**: No new projects until exercise routine established

### End of Month Rush

- **Risk**: August 31 financial scramble
- **Mitigation**: Start financial review Monday evening
- **Time Block**: Tuesday 2-4 PM for finances

## Notes & Reminders

- Week 34's lesson: Specific, actionable first steps beat vague goals
- Redis migration success shows capability for complex technical tasks
- Health implementation requires same precision as technical work
- Pool project could solve multiple problems - worth serious research
- September starts with Palm Springs trip - plan accordingly

## Week 35 Mantra

*"Implementation beats intention. One specific exercise beats a whole book unread."*
