# 2025 Annual Plan

**Guiding Principles**

- Value

    Succinctly summarize what you value most in life. (Pulling from what you highlighted in the steps above). Revisit those answers to shape these bullet points. Over time, refine these to be as concise as possible.

  - Love
  - The outdoors
  - Friends
  - Travel

- Purpose

    What purpose do I serve or intend to serve?

  - Authentic refuge in difficult times

    Who depends on me? (or will depend on me at some point)

  - Older gay men & admirers
  - Buster
  - Friends

    Why do I want to deliver for them? (or Why will I want to deliver for them?)

  - It’s getting harder to feel safe and Out
  - Buster’s life’s entwined with mine
  - We renew each other

- Meaning

    Why does this purpose matter? What meaning derives from this purpose?

  - We’re reassured that our time isn’t wasted, and the next generations can grow from it

- Manifestation

    How I will show these Values and fulfill this Meaning in my actions

  - I’ll be available to OGM members
  - I’ll directly support my friends
  - I’ll march in the streets and go to jail as the Trump regime demands

- Foundational Statement

    Write out 3 to 5 lines on what defines your purpose in life. Really craft this, shape it into something that feels somewhat poetic. Make it as tight and succinct as possible. You will repeat this to yourself in every weekly review.
