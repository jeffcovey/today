### 🎯 Current Status Assessment

**Most Urgent:**
- Financial tracking crisis - You're withdrawing from retirement funds without visibility into expenses
- 3 overdue personal messages requiring immediate response
- 153 emails accumulating in SaneBox digest (plus 129 from yesterday)

**Key Patterns:**
- Communication backlog growing (personal + OGM members)
- Health habits need attention (alcohol daily, insufficient cardio)
- Administrative tasks piling up (paperwork, expense tracking)

### 📋 Today's Top 5 Priorities

1. **Set up expense tracker (30 mins)** - Create simple spreadsheet: income, expenses, insurance dates, 401k withdrawals
2. **Send 3 overdue replies (15 mins)** - Brief acknowledgments to Melv, David Edwards, Rosemary
3. **Process email backlog (45 mins)** - SaneBox digest first, then Airbnb reviews
4. **OGM community update (20 mins)** - Post about recent work, check newsletter status
5. **Evening walk (30 mins)** - Start cardio routine for heart health
