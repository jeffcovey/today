# Daily Review: Thursday, August 14, 2025
**Theme: Back Stage Day** 🛠️

## 🎯 Current Status Assessment

### Update (10:30 AM ET)
**Morning status check** - Current situation:
- ✅ **Guest Room Ready**: Confirmed ready with door code sent
- **Diner Run**: Bagel Snack scheduled for 1:00 PM (in ~2.5 hours) at 1237 Powerline Pompano Beach
- **Airbnb Guest**: Arriving at 3PM (~4.5 hours from now)
- Calendar shows "Reserved" all day (Airbnb booking confirmed)

### 🚨 New Concerns (10:30 AM)
**Critical Realization**: You've been so focused on the AI management system that you've turned every day into a "Back Stage" day and are overdue for OGM member communications!

**Urgent OGM Communications Needed**:
- Review and reply to messages on the site
- Check discussion boards and chat room
- Post summaries of recent work
- Notify both regular members and Patreon members

**Technical Note**: Todoist sync has been more trouble than it's worth - consider simplifying to just Notion → local notes sync

### Immediate Attention

- **Diner Run**: Bagel Snack at 1:00 PM (1237 Powerline Pompano Beach) - 3 hours blocked
