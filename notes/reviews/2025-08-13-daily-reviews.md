# Daily Reviews

This directory contains daily review notes generated by the `bin/today` command.

## Structure

Each file is named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` and contains:

1. **Morning Review** - The initial analysis from Claude with priorities and recommendations
2. **Progress Log** - Checkboxes to track task completion throughout the day
3. **Updates** - Timestamped entries added when running `bin/today` again or using `bin/progress`

## Workflow

### Morning

```bash
bin/today  # Creates initial review with priorities
```

### Throughout the Day

```bash
bin/progress "Completed expense tracker setup"  # Add quick progress note
bin/progress  # Opens review file in editor for detailed updates
```

### Evening

```bash
bin/today  # Generates updated analysis based on changes during the day
```

## Benefits

- **Continuous tracking** - See what was planned vs accomplished
- **Historical record** - Review past days to identify patterns
- **Progress visibility** - Clear view of daily achievements
- **AI insights** - Claude's analysis saved for future reference
