### Progress Update (14:29)
Completed the inbox processing refactor! Now Drafts uploads go to inbox and get filed automatically. Also added concerns folder and improved update-summary to scan all concern files.

### Progress Update (12:33 PM Eastern)
I was enjoying working with our new AI-based "Today" system, and decided to stay home and keep playing with it on my "Off Stage" day. Skipping both of the social opportunities. I feel like I need to get myself squared away, especially with regard to finances and fixing OlderGay.Men bugs, before I can go out with a clear conscience.
I ordered some gin, and am drinking and not eating mindfully. I felt like I wanted to be in a buzzed space to get through this work, but need to ease myself off alcohol as I get more on top of things. On the bright side, it's a breezy day, and I've been able to keep all the windows open with a fan going, and enjoy the fresh air and the sounds of nature.
