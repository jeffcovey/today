### Progress Update (18:16)
I spent the morning finishing our script to synchronize our notes and projects with Drafts. I didn't plan to spend the whole morning on this, and it doesn't match the day's theme or plan, but it will give me a comfortable, portable environment in which to work.

### Progress Update (18:16)
Drafts syncing is working well. We need to update the Palm Springs project with recent updates about Lou's plans and Vince's house sitting.

### Progress Update (18:16)
8/12/25 8:23PM EST
I drank more gin than food today, and have ended the day quite soused. I improved synchronization for our task management system, added support for projects, and worked on synchronizing our notes and projects with Drafts. I could have exercised more, but feel OK about my day off. Still eating mindlessly and neglecting my finances, but resolved a few problems for OGM members today. Need to book that Palm Springs ticket.
Kept the windows open all day! Fans made it possible, and will hopefully keep it possible tonight. Going to bed eager to see what's on the docket in the morning.
