## 📝 Notes

**Recent Concerns:** You have several concern notes from Aug 13, including one about Duolingo time being entirely about chess. Consider if this aligns with your goals.

**Overdue Items:** The fridge water lines, Virgin Red points, and exercise bike have been pending since Monday. Tomorrow (Front Stage) might be better for dealing with these.
