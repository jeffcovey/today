## 🎯 Today's Priorities (4:30 PM - Evening)

### 1. 🏠 IMMEDIATE: Prepare Private Suite (45-60 minutes)
**Logan arrives at 8 PM!** Tasks needed:
- Strip bed and wash linens
- Clean bathroom thoroughly  
- Vacuum/sweep floors
- Fresh towels and amenities
- Check room temperature and lighting
- Quick review message for Shwet

### 2. Quick Health Breaks (During laundry cycles)
While sheets are washing/drying:
- **Inversion table** - Quick relief while waiting
- **Tai Chi standing** - 4 minutes between tasks
- Take walking breaks to check laundry

### 3. Light OGM Check (After room is ready)
If time permits after room prep:
- Quick scan of site messages for anything urgent
- Defer comprehensive work to tomorrow (Saturday is Front Stage)

## 🌙 Evening Wind-Down (7:30-9:30 PM)

### Off Stage Activities
- Read those saved articles (only 5 minutes total)
- Enjoy some personal time
- Prepare for bed by 9:30 PM

### Tomorrow Prep
Saturday is a **Front Stage** day - perfect for:
- All the OGM communication tasks
- Catching up on overdue home maintenance
- Social interactions

## 📝 Notes

**Recent Concerns:** You have several concern notes from Aug 13, including one about Duolingo time being entirely about chess. Consider if this aligns with your goals.

**Overdue Items:** The fridge water lines, Virgin Red points, and exercise bike have been pending since Monday. Tomorrow (Front Stage) might be better for dealing with these.
