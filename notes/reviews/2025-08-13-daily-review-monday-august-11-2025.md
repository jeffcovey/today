### End of day review from Jeff (user)

There was some confusion, and for most of the day, we thought the theme was “Back Stage”. So our planned tasks were a little off. Still, I accomplished a good deal.

I answered a few messages from Nelson Minar, and feel good about that. I still owe him several replies. I’d like to make them in the next day or two. The next old message I should reply to from him is from August 2.

Feeling better and cooler with my haircut.

Financial worries are still my biggest concern, especially because I don’t know what I have and what’s coming in and going out. I spent 20 minutes on it this morning, but even then, I was easily distracted and didn’t accomplish a lot. If I put in an hour with YNAB and balance my accounts, it will be a good start.

Melv, David Edwards, and Rosemary are friends and family. Their replies should wait for an Off Stage day.

I started the day with a 30-minute yoga workout. It helped, I should keep it up. I got in my steps and got some exercise cleaning the house and guest rooms, but I didn’t get to Tai Chi. Practiced zazen both morning and evening. Drank two beers instead of hard liquor, but ate mindlessly and too much.

A true Front Stage day would have prioritized talking to OGM members and staff. And I’m at least a week overdue posting a summary of my coding work.

The guest rooms were made up with plenty of time for 3PM check-ins. No one booked them, but that usual in the off season. It’s good that they’re ready when needed.

Now that I’ve decided about going to Palm Springs, I should buy tickets before prices go up. I plan to be there Sept 4 - 12.
