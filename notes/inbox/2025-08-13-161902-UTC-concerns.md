# Concerns

- I can't log in at https://identity.virginatlantic.com/ to try to use my Virgin Red points on a Delta flight to Palm Springs. I remember having trouble linking my Virgin Red and Virgin Atlantic Flying Club accounts. I think that was resolved, but was there also a problem with logging in? I've requested a code and reset my password several times. It says the new password was accepted, but rejects it when I try to log in.
