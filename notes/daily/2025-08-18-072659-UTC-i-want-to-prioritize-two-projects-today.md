I want to prioritize two projects today:

1. I want to create a project for treating my arthritis. Call it "Treat Arthritis". I just created a note about a book related to this project; add it to the project file. Also assign the project to the task I just added about the "Hip Hook/Mark". Find my appointments with Orthopaedic Center of South Florida in my calendar, and add them to the project.
2. I want to work on a plan for this week in the week's file in plans/.

Please carry out these tasks, then emphasize these two areas of concern in today's plan, along with the usual daily plan building.
