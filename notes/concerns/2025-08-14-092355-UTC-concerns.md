- I've been obsessively working on this AI-based management system. While I'm excited about the progress I've made, it's turned every day into a "Back Stage" day. I want to continue working on it today, but I'm overdue to communicate with OGM members. I need to review my Front communications, reply to messages on the site, check the discussion boards and chat room, and, most importantly, post summaries of recent work. I need to then notify normal members and Patreon members of what I've been doing.
