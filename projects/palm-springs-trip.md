## Overview

Lou Sanfelice will be housesitting for his friend Julian DiCiurcio and his husband  at:

38341 Bogert Trail
Palm Springs CA 92264

I hoped to join him 8/29-9/12, but I have an orthopedic appointment on 9/3, so I'm going for 9/4-12 instead. We will have use of Julian's car, so we don't need to arrange for housing or transportation.
