> Did we make a mistake in naming our files in vault/plans/? Their filenames were supposed to sort 
  so a year would appear before a quarter, which appeared before a month, which appeared before a 
  week, followed by all the days in that week, followed by the next week, etc. So there's a clear 
  grouping and hierarchy.

● I'll check the current naming structure of files in vault/plans/ to see if they follow the
  intended hierarchical sorting.

● List(vault/plans)
  ⎿  Listed 28 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Yes, there's a naming issue. The current structure has problems:

  1. Quarters are named like 2025-Q3.md
  2. Months are named like 2025-Q3-08.md (August in Q3)
  3. Weeks are named like 2025-Q3-08-W33.md
  4. Days are named like 2025-Q3-08-25.md

  The problem: Days (e.g., 2025-Q3-08-10.md) sort alphabetically before weeks (e.g.,
  2025-Q3-08-W33.md) because numbers come before 'W'.

  For proper hierarchical sorting, you'd want:
  - Year: 2025.md ✓
  - Quarter: 2025-Q3.md ✓
  - Month: 2025-Q3-08.md ✓
  - Week: 2025-Q3-08-W33.md → Should be 2025-Q3-08-33.md or 2025-Q3-08-week-33.md
  - Day: 2025-Q3-08-25.md → Should be 2025-Q3-08-25-day.md or 2025-Q3-08-day-25.md

  Or alternatively use prefixes that naturally sort:
  - 2025-Q3-08-1-week-33.md
  - 2025-Q3-08-2-day-25.md

  The current naming causes days to appear before weeks in the sort order.

> No, it's worse than that:  ls -C1 vault/plans/
  2025-Q1.md
  2025-Q2.md
  2025-Q3-08-10.md
  2025-Q3-08-11.md
  2025-Q3-08-12.md
  2025-Q3-08-13.md
  2025-Q3-08-14.md
  2025-Q3-08-15.md
  2025-Q3-08-16.md
  2025-Q3-08-17.md
  2025-Q3-08-18.md
  2025-Q3-08-19.md
  2025-Q3-08-20.md
  2025-Q3-08-21.md
  2025-Q3-08-22.md
  2025-Q3-08-23.md
  2025-Q3-08-24.md
  2025-Q3-08-25.md
  2025-Q3-08-W33.md
  2025-Q3-08-W34.md
  2025-Q3-08.md
  2025-Q3.md
  2025-Q4.md
  2025.md

● You're absolutely right - it's much worse! The files are sorting in this broken order:

  1. 2025-Q1.md (Q1)
  2. 2025-Q2.md (Q2)
  3. 2025-Q3-08-10.md through 2025-Q3-08-25.md (days)
  4. 2025-Q3-08-W33.md, 2025-Q3-08-W34.md (weeks)
  5. 2025-Q3-08.md (month!)
  6. 2025-Q3.md (quarter!)
  7. 2025-Q4.md (Q4)
  8. 2025.md (year!)

  The year, quarter, and month files are appearing after their child elements because of
  alphabetical sorting. The dash-number combinations sort before just the dash alone.

  To fix this hierarchy, you need a naming scheme where parents sort before children:

  Option 1 - Zero padding:
  - 2025-00.md (year)
  - 2025-Q3-00.md (quarter)
  - 2025-Q3-08-00.md (month)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33.md (week)
  - 2025-Q3-08-D10.md (day)

  Option 2 - Underscore prefix:
  - 2025.md (year)
  - 2025-Q3_.md (quarter)
  - 2025-Q3-08_.md (month)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33.md (week)
  - 2025-Q3-08-D10.md (day)

  Option 3 - Type indicators:
  - 2025-Y.md (year)
  - 2025-Q3-Q.md (quarter)
  - 2025-Q3-08-M.md (month)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33.md (week)
  - 2025-Q3-08-D10.md (day)

> Option 1 looks the cleanest to me. But wouldn't days (with D) sort before weeks (with W)? We want
   all the days in a week grouped together under their week's plan.

● You're absolutely right! With D coming before W alphabetically, days would sort before their
  parent week. That breaks the hierarchy.

  For proper grouping where weeks appear first, followed by their days, you need:

  Fixed Option 1:
  - 2025-00.md (year)
  - 2025-Q3-00.md (quarter)
  - 2025-Q3-08-00.md (month)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33-00.md (week)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33-01.md (Monday)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33-02.md (Tuesday)
  - 2025-Q3-08-W33-03.md (Wednesday)
  - etc.

  This way:
  - Year sorts first
  - Quarter sorts before month
  - Month sorts before weeks
  - Each week sorts before its days
  - Days are clearly grouped under their week

  The key is using the week number as part of the day's filename, then adding the day number
  (01-07) or actual date.

> We should use the actual date of the month, so, e.g. "August 19" is clear at a glance (minus the 
  week notation between). Please rename our files this way.

● I'll rename the files to follow the proper hierarchical structure with actual dates. Let me
  create a todo list and start renaming.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Rename year file: 2025.md to 2025-00.md             
     ☐ Rename quarter files (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
     ☐ Rename month file: 2025-Q3-08.md to 2025-Q3-08-00.md
     ☐ Rename week files (W33, W34)
     ☐ Rename day files to include week prefix

  ⎿  (No content)

● Now I need to figure out which days belong to which week. Let me check the calendar to determine
  the week boundaries.

● Bash(cal -m 8 2025)
  ⎿  Error: /bin/bash: line 1: cal: command not found

● Bash(date -d "2025-08-11" "+%V")
  ⎿  33

● Bash(date -d "2025-08-18" "+%V")
  ⎿  34

● So Week 33 starts Aug 11 and Week 34 starts Aug 18. Let me check what day of week these are:

● Bash(date -d "2025-08-11" "+%A" && date -d "2025-08-18" "+%A")
  ⎿  Monday
     Monday

● Perfect! So:
  - Week 33: Aug 11-17 (Mon-Sun)
  - Week 34: Aug 18-24 (Mon-Sun)
  - Aug 10 is in the previous week (32)
  - Aug 25 is in week 35

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Rename year file: 2025.md to 2025-00.md             
     ☒ Rename quarter files (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
     ☒ Rename month file: 2025-Q3-08.md to 2025-Q3-08-00.md
     ☒ Rename week files (W33, W34)
     ☐ Rename day files to include week prefix

● Bash(# Week 32 (Aug 10 is Sunday of week 32)
      mv 2025-Q3-08-10.md 2025-Q3-08-W32-10.md…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Wait, I need to add the W32 week file for Aug 10:

● Bash(touch 2025-Q3-08-W32-00.md && touch 2025-Q3-08-W35-00.md)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Update Todos

     ☒ Rename week files (W33, W34)
     ☒ Rename day files to include week prefix

● Bash(ls -C1)
  ⎿  2025-00.md                    
     2025-Q1-00.md
     2025-Q2-00.md
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! The files now sort correctly with proper hierarchy:
  - Year (2025-00.md)
  - Quarters (2025-Q3-00.md)
  - Month (2025-Q3-08-00.md)
  - Weeks (2025-Q3-08-W33-00.md)
  - Days grouped under their weeks (2025-Q3-08-W33-19.md)

  The dates are preserved in the filenames (e.g., -19 for August 19th), making them clear at a
  glance while maintaining the hierarchical sort order.

> let me see it with underscores instead of hyphens.

● Bash(for file in *.md; do mv "$file" "${file//-/_}"; done)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(ls -C1)
  ⎿  2025_00.md                    
     2025_Q1_00.md
     2025_Q2_00.md
     … +23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● There's the structure with underscores instead of hyphens. The hierarchy still sorts correctly:
  - Year: 2025_00.md
  - Quarters: 2025_Q3_00.md
  - Month: 2025_Q3_08_00.md
  - Weeks: 2025_Q3_08_W33_00.md
  - Days: 2025_Q3_08_W33_19.md

       11 +     - Create or update today's plan file in `vault/plans/YYYY_QQ_MM_W##_DD.md`
       12       - Provide recommendations based on your schedule and priorities
       13       - Continue working with you as long as needed

             (3 PM)**
       38    4. **📊 Check Hierarchical Plans** (BEFORE creating today's plan!)
       39 -     - Read the year plan (`vault/plans/YYYY.md`) to understand annual objectives
       40 -     - Check the quarter plan (`vault/plans/YYYY-QQ.md`) for current initiatives
       41 -     - Review the month plan (`vault/plans/YYYY-QQ-MM.md`) for this month's focus
       42 -     - Look at the week plan (`vault/plans/YYYY-QQ-MM-W##.md`) if it exists
       39 +     - Read the year plan (`vault/plans/YYYY_00.md`) to understand annual objectives
       40 +     - Check the quarter plan (`vault/plans/YYYY_QQ_00.md`) for current initiatives
       41 +     - Review the month plan (`vault/plans/YYYY_QQ_MM_00.md`) for this month's focus
       42 +     - Look at the week plan (`vault/plans/YYYY_QQ_MM_W##_00.md`) if it exists
       43       - THEN create/update today's plan to align with these higher goals
       44 -  5. Check if a plan file exists for today in `vault/plans/YYYY-QQ-MM-DD.md` (e.g., 
     `vault/plans/2025-Q3-08-16.md`)
          - `vault/plans/2025-Q3-08-16.md`)
       44 +  5. Check if a plan file exists for today in `vault/plans/YYYY_QQ_MM_W##_DD.md` (e.g., 
     `vault/plans/2025_Q3_08_W33_16.md`)
          + `vault/plans/2025_Q3_08_W33_16.md`)
       45       - **If today's review EXISTS**:
       46         - Load the existing review file
       47         - Query the database for recent changes (using SQL queries)
     ...
       61    
       62    ### Plan Files Structure
       63    
       64 -  Plans are organized in a flat structure in the `vault/plans/` directory with the 
     naming scheme:
          -  scheme:
       65 -  - **Daily plans**: `YYYY-QQ-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-Q3-08-16.md`)
       66 -  - **Weekly plans**: `YYYY-QQ-MM-W##.md` (e.g., `2025-Q3-08-W03.md`)
       67 -  - **Monthly plans**: `YYYY-QQ-MM.md` (e.g., `2025-Q3-08.md`)
       68 -  - **Quarterly plans**: `YYYY-QQ.md` (e.g., `2025-Q3.md`)
       69 -  - **Yearly plans**: `YYYY.md` (e.g., `2025.md`)
       64 +  Plans are organized in a flat structure in the `vault/plans/` directory with a 
     hierarchical naming scheme that ensures proper sorting:
          + hierarchical naming scheme that ensures proper sorting:

       70    
       71 -  This naming ensures files sort alphabetically with higher-level plans appearing before 
     their sub-plans. When creating new plan files:
          - their sub-plans. When creating new plan files:
       71 +  The `_00` suffix for aggregate levels (year, quarter, month, week) ensures they sort 
     before their child items. Days include their week number (W##) to group them properly under
     their respective weeks. When creating new plan files:
          + before their child items. Days include their week number (W##) to group them properly 
          + under their respective weeks. When creating new plan files:
       72    1. Check if higher-level plans exist (year, quarter, month)
       73    2. Reference objectives from higher-level plans in lower-level ones
       74    3. Roll up completed items from daily plans to weekly/monthly summaries

● Documentation updated with the new naming convention! The key changes:
  - Year: YYYY_00.md
  - Quarter: YYYY_QQ_00.md
  - Month: YYYY_QQ_MM_00.md
  - Week: YYYY_QQ_MM_W##_00.md
  - Day: YYYY_QQ_MM_W##_DD.md

  This ensures proper hierarchical sorting where parent levels appear before their children.

● All files have been updated to use the new naming convention:
  - Changed from hyphens to underscores
  - Added week numbers (W##) to daily files
  - Added _00 suffix to aggregate levels (year, quarter, month, week)
  - Updated regex patterns and file path generation in all scripts

  The new format ensures proper hierarchical sorting where parent levels appear before their
  children.

> OK. Nothing is showing in "Plans" now on the web server home page.

● Let me see where the "All Plans" link goes:

● Search(pattern: "All Plans|Browse all plans", path: "src/web-server.js", output_mode: "content")

● Let me check how the links are generated when there are no specific plan files:

● Read(src/web-server.js)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The issue is that the Plans section only shows specific plan files (week, month, quarter, year)
  if they exist. There's no fallback to show all plan files when none of those specific files
  exist. Let me check if we're at least showing the plans directory link in the main listing:

● Bash(curl -s http://localhost:3456/ | grep -i "plans\|calendar" | head -20)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Let me restart the web server to pick up the changes:

     … +20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! The Plans section is showing the month, quarter, and year files with the new naming
  format. But it's not showing week files or the direct link to browse all plans. Let me also add a
   fallback link to browse all plan files:

> No, that's already in the directory listing.

● You're right! The plans folder is already in the main directory listing. The Plans section in the
   sidebar is now working correctly - it's showing the month, quarter, and year files that exist
  with the new naming format (2025_Q3_08_00.md, 2025_Q3_00.md, 2025_00.md).

  The section was empty before because it was looking for files with the old naming pattern (with
  hyphens), but now that we updated the parsePlanFile function and the file name generation, it's
  finding and displaying the files correctly.

  Is there something specific about the Plans section that's not working as expected?

> You were goin to fix the link to today's plan on the home page.

● You're right! The "Today's Plan" link on the home page won't work because today's file doesn't
  exist yet with the new naming format. Let me check what today's filename should be and create it:

● Bash(date "+%Y_%m_%d_%V")
  ⎿  2025_08_26_35

● Today is August 26, 2025, Week 35. The file should be 2025_Q3_08_W35_26.md. Let me check if it
  exists:

● Bash(ls -la vault/plans/2025_Q3_08_W35_26.md 2>/dev/null || echo "File does not exist")
  ⎿  File does not exist

● The file doesn't exist. Let me create it by copying from an existing day file:

● Bash(ls vault/plans/2025_Q3_08_W*_*.md | head -1)
  ⎿  ls: cannot access 'glob': No such file or directory

● Bash(ls vault/plans/ | grep "W35")

  ⎿  2025_08_25_35

● You're right - today is August 25th in EDT. Let me check what timezone the web server is using:

● Search(pattern: "new Date\(\)|getFullYear|getMonth|getDate", path: "src/web-server.js",
        output_mode: "content", head_limit: 10)
  ⎿  Found 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The web server is using new Date() which uses the system's default timezone (UTC). It should be
  using Eastern time. Let me fix that:

● Read(src/web-server.js)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I need to make the web server use Eastern timezone. Let me update it:

● Update(src/web-server.js)

       928 -      const today = new Date();
       928 +      // Use Eastern timezone for consistency with other scripts
       929 +      const easternTime = new Date(new Date().toLocaleString("en-US", {timeZone: 
           + "America/New_York"}));
       930 +      const today = easternTime;
       931        const year = today.getFullYear();
       932        const quarter = `Q${Math.floor(today.getMonth() / 3) + 1}`;
       933        const month = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');

● Now let me restart the web server and check if the Today's Plan link appears:

● Bash(pkill -f "node.*web-server" && sleep 1 && nohup node src/web-server.js > /tmp/web-server.log
       2>&1 &)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(sleep 2 && curl -s http://localhost:3001/ | grep -A5 "Today's Plan")
  ⎿  No matches found

● The Today's Plan link isn't showing up because the file 2025_Q3_08_W35_25.md exists for August
  25. Let me check what the web server thinks today's filename should be:

● Bash(tail -20 /tmp/web-server.log)
  ⎿  [dotenvx@1.49.0] injecting env (27) from .env
     Web server running on http://localhost:3001
     Username: admin
     … +8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me add some debug logging to see what filename it's looking for:

● Read(src/web-server.js)
  ⎿  Read 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> Huh? No, it shows fine now.

● Great! The Today's Plan link is showing up now. The fix was updating the web server to use
  Eastern timezone (like all the other scripts) and ensuring the filename format matches the new
  convention with underscores and week numbers (2025_Q3_08_W35_25.md for August 25, 2025).

  The web server now correctly:
  1. Uses Eastern timezone for date calculations
  2. Generates filenames with the new format: YYYY_QQ_MM_W##_DD.md
  3. Shows the Today's Plan link when the file exists
  4. Lists the available month, quarter, and year plans in the sidebar

  Everything should be working properly with the new naming convention now!

  - Quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3) - Orange business-time icons, indented once
  - Month (August) - Green calendar icon, indented twice
  - Weeks (W33, W34) - Blue calendar-week icons, indented three times
  - Days - Blue calendar-day icons, indented four times

  The files are sorted hierarchically and the indentation makes the structure clear at a glance!

        72 +  Week 34 evolved from an arthritis-focused health week into a major technical and 
           + financial achievement week. While the original health goals saw limited progress, the 
           + week delivered exceptional results in system development, financial recovery, and 
           + project planning. The highlight was Saturday's Redis migration saving $90/month and 
     the
           +  creation of an AI web interface.

       136 +  
       137 +  - **Arthritis Treatment:** Week's main focus largely unmet
       138 +    - Only 20 minutes of book reading vs 210 minutes planned (7×30min)
       139 +    - No exercise implementation despite it being priority #1

       142 +  
       143 +  ### Health & Wellness Gaps
       144 +  
       145 +  - **Exercise & Movement:** Minimal physical activity beyond stretching
       146 +  - **Alcohol consumption:** Pattern continues unchanged
       147 +  - **Sleep schedule:** Inconsistent bedtimes noted
       148 +  
       149 +  ### Communication & Tasks
       150 +  
       151 +  - **Backlog items:** Some personal messages still pending
       152 +  - **Project documentation:** Several project files need updates
       153 +  
       154 +  ## Unexpected Wins & Surprises

        9 +  
       10 +  **Status:** Research Phase - Stalled  
       11 +  **Progress:** Book started but not implemented  
       12 +  **Blocker:** Need clear Day 1 exercise instructions  
       13 +  
       14 +  ### Week 34 Planned vs Actual
       15 +  - ❌ Exercise implementation (0% - blocked on unclear starting point)

  3. Backyard Pool
    - Status updated to "Active Research"
    - Added Week 34 insights about dual benefits
    - Listed next actions for contractor estimates

  The review follows the same comprehensive format as Week 33, capturing accomplishments,
  challenges, patterns, project updates, and lessons learned. The key theme was how technical
  opportunities (Redis migration) overshadowed health goals, leading to major financial wins but
  limited arthritis progress.

> Great. Let's create a plan for the current week (34) in its file.

● I think there's a small confusion - we just completed the review for Week 34 (August 18-24), and
  today is August 25th which is the start of Week 35. Let me create a plan for Week 35 (August
  25-31):

● Bash(TZ='America/New_York' date "+Week %V: %B %d-%d, %Y")
  ⎿  Week 35: August 25-25, 2025

     # Week 35 Plan - August 25-31, 2025
     ## Week Theme: Implementation & Momentum
     Building on Week 34's technical victories while addressing neglected health priorities. This
     week focuses on converting research into action, maintaining financial momentum, and preparing
     for September transitions.
     ## Primary Focus Areas
     ### 1. Arthritis Treatment - Actual Implementation 💪
     … +141 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I've created the Week 35 plan (August 25-31) with a strong focus on:

  1. Actually implementing arthritis exercises - with specific requirement to extract Day 1 routine
   by Tuesday
  2. Maintaining Railway migration momentum - planning Phase 2 (database migration)
  3. Financial organization - completing August review before month-end

  The plan incorporates Week 34's key lesson: vague goals fail, specific actions succeed. That's
  why the arthritis section now has concrete deliverables like "CREATE CHECKLIST" and "Document
  exercises with specific reps/duration."

  The plan also includes:
  - Daily structure with morning exercise blocks
  - Pool project research tasks
  - Risk mitigation strategies to prevent health goals from being overridden
  - Clear success metrics divided into Must/Should/Nice to have

  The mantra emphasizes action over planning: "Implementation beats intention. One specific 
  exercise beats a whole book unread."
